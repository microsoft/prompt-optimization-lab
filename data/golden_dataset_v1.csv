0,What is MICs current exposure in the USA in PE?,[],"['MIC_BY_COUNTRY_VW', 'INVESTMENT_KPI_VW']","MIC_BY_ASSET_CLASS_VW, MIC_BY_COUNTRY_VW","The question asks for ""MIC's current exposure in the USA in PE."" Let's break this down:
- ""MIC"" refers to Mubadala Investment Company, so we need data at the MIC (portfolio) level.
- ""Current exposure"" means the present fair market value or unrealized value of investments.
- ""USA"" means we need a breakdown by country, specifically ""United States of America.""
- ""PE"" means Private Equity, which is an asset class.

We need a view that can provide:
- Aggregated exposure (unrealized value) for MIC
- Filtered by country (USA)
- Filtered by asset class (Private Equity)

Reviewing the candidate views:
- MIC KPI View: Aggregated for all of MIC, but does NOT break down by country or asset class.
- MIC Asset Class View: Aggregated by asset class, but NOT by country.
- MIC Country View: Aggregated by country, but NOT by asset class.
- Platform Country View: Aggregated by platform and country, but not at the MIC (all-platform) level.
- Platform Asset Class View: Aggregated by platform and asset class, but not by country.
- Investment KPI View: Can filter by asset class and country at the individual investment level, but not aggregated at the MIC level.
- Business Unit/Region/Sector/Investment Class Views: Not relevant as the question is not about business units, regions, or sectors.

The only view that provides both country and asset class breakdowns at the MIC level is missing. However, the closest match is MIC Country View, which gives exposure by country, and Investment KPI View, which can be used to filter for asset class and country at the deal level and aggregate up.

Therefore, the best approach is to use both:
- MIC Country View: For total exposure in the USA (but not filtered by asset class).
- Investment KPI View: To filter for investments in the USA and in Private Equity, then sum the unrealized value for current exposure.

Per the selectors, when aggregated views lack required filter dimensions, use Investment KPI View in parallel.",0,"If PE is referred to as platform then PLATFORM_BY_COUNTRY_VW , if PE is referred to as asset class then INVESTMENT_KPI_VW","PLATFORM_BY_COUNTRY_VW, INVESTMENT_KPI_VW"

""Current exposure"" typically refers to the fair market value or unrealized value of investments. The GCC is a regional grouping, so the answer must be filtered by region (GCC countries: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates).

Key requirements:
- Aggregated exposure (not deal-level, not business unit, not sector, not asset class breakdowns, but by region and platform/investment class).
- Must be for MIC (not ADIC).
- Must be for Private Equity (either as platform or asset/investment class).
- Must be for the GCC region (which is a subset of ""Middle East & North Africa"" or can be filtered by specific countries).

View analysis:
- MIC KPI View: Aggregated for all of MIC, but does not allow regional or asset class breakdowns.
- MIC Region View: Aggregated at region level for all of MIC, but does not allow filtering by asset/investment class or platform.
- MIC Country View: Aggregated at country level for all of MIC, but does not allow filtering by asset/investment class or platform.
- MIC Asset Class View: Aggregated at asset class level for all of MIC, but does not allow regional breakdowns.
- Platform Region View: Aggregated at BOTH region and platform level. This allows filtering for Private Equity platform and for GCC region (by country or by ""Middle East & North Africa"").
- Platform Country View: Aggregated at BOTH country and platform level. This allows filtering for Private Equity platform and for each GCC country.
- Platform KPI View: Aggregated at platform level only, no regional breakdown.
- Platform Investment Class View: Aggregated at BOTH investment class and platform, but not by region/country.
- Investment KPI View: Individual investment level, can be filtered by region/country and asset class, but is not aggregated.
- Business Unit/Asset Class/Sector views: Not relevant, as the question is not about business units or sectors.

Best fit:
- Platform Region View (PLATFORM_BY_REGION_VW): Allows aggregation by platform (Private Equity) and region (can select ""Middle East & North Africa"" or sum up GCC countries if available).
- Platform Country View (PLATFORM_BY_COUNTRY_VW): Allows aggregation by platform (Private Equity) and by each GCC country, for more granular breakdown if needed.

- ""Europe"" is a geographical region.
- ""Group (MIC)"" refers to the Mubadala Investment Company at the group/portfolio level, not a specific platform, business unit, or sector.
- The user wants the data segmented by region (Europe) for the MIC group.

From the candidate views:
- MIC_KPI_VW: Aggregates across all of MIC, but does NOT provide breakdowns by region, sector, or geography.
- MIC_BY_REGION_VW: Aggregates at the region level for all of MIC, with ""Europe & Central Asia"" as a possible region value. This view provides exactly the required breakdown: exposure (unrealized value) for Europe for the MIC group.
- PLATFORM_BY_REGION_VW: Aggregates by both platform and region, but the user did not request a platform breakdown.
- MIC_BY_COUNTRY_VW: Aggregates by country, but the user asked for region, not country.
- Other views (sector, asset class, investment class, business unit, deal-level) are not relevant because the user did not request those breakdowns.

This requires:

1. ""Current exposures"" implies the latest fair market value or unrealized value, which is typically represented by the ""UNREALIZED_VALUE"" field in the KPI views.
2. ""Across all platforms and units"" means the answer must be broken down by both platform and business unit, not just one or the other, and not as a total aggregate.
3. ""Pharmaceuticals"" is a sector/industry. In the database, this is represented by the GICS sector/industry classification, specifically ""Pharmaceuticals"" in the GICS_INDUSTRY or GICS_SECTOR columns.

View selection logic:
- Views that aggregate only by platform (Platform KPI View) or only by business unit (Business Unit KPI View) are not sufficient, as the user wants a breakdown by both.
- Views that aggregate by both platform and sector (Platform Sector View) are close, but do not include business unit breakdowns.
- Views that aggregate by both business unit and sector (Business Unit Sector View) provide metrics at BOTH business unit and sector level, but not platform.
- The only view that allows for breakdown by BOTH platform and sector is the ""PLATFORM_BY_SECTOR_VW"" (Platform Sector View). However, it does not include business unit.
- The only view that allows for breakdown by BOTH business unit and sector is the ""BUSINESS_UNIT_BY_SECTOR_VW"" (Business Unit Sector View). It does not include platform.
- There is no view that aggregates by platform, business unit, and sector simultaneously.

Therefore, to answer the question as fully as possible, we need to use BOTH:
- PLATFORM_BY_SECTOR_VW: to get exposures by platform in Pharmaceuticals.
- BUSINESS_UNIT_BY_SECTOR_VW: to get exposures by business unit in Pharmaceuticals.

Both views have a GICS_SECTOR column, but the user asked for ""Pharmaceuticals,"" which is a GICS_INDUSTRY, not a sector. However, in these views, the closest mapping is GICS_SECTOR = ""35 - Health Care"", and within that, the industry ""Pharmaceuticals"" is a subset. Since the views only allow filtering at the sector level, we can only provide exposures for the Health Care sector, or, if the view allows, filter for ""Pharmaceuticals"" if present in the GICS_SECTOR or GICS_INDUSTRY columns.

In summary, to provide the best possible answer, select both PLATFORM_BY_SECTOR_VW and BUSINESS_UNIT_BY_SECTOR_VW, filtering for the sector/industry ""Pharmaceuticals"" (or ""35 - Health Care"" if ""Pharmaceuticals"" is not available).",1,INVESTMENT_KPI_VW,INVESTMENT_KPI_VW

4. **Business Unit KPI View**: Aggregates by business unit only, not by platform and country together.

5. **Platform Country View**: Aggregates by both platform and country. Columns include PLATFORM (with ""Real Assets"" as an allowed value) and COUNTRY (with ""United Arab Emirates"" as an allowed value). This view is designed for questions that require exposure (unrealized value) for a specific platform in a specific country. This is the best fit.

6. **MIC KPI View, MIC Country View, MIC Region View, etc.**: These aggregate at the company, country, or region level, but not by platform and country together.

7. **Other views (Allocations, Consumption, etc.)**: These are for capital allocation/consumption, not for reporting exposures.

The user also mentions ""Report Group,"" which, in the absence of further context, is interpreted as referring to the overall Mubadala group (i.e., all investments, not a specific platform, business unit, or sector).

To select the correct view:
- The view must provide exposure (unrealized value) aggregated by asset class.
- The view should not require breakdowns by platform, business unit, sector, region, or country, unless the question specifically asks for those.

The phrase ""Report Group"" is ambiguous, but in Mubadala context, it usually refers to the overall group (i.e., Mubadala Investment Company as a whole), unless otherwise specified.

To answer this, we need a view that provides exposure (unrealized value) aggregated by GICS sector for the entire group. Let's analyze the candidate views:

- MIC Sector View (MIC_BY_SECTOR_VW): This view contains KPIs for investments aggregated at the sector level only for all of Mubadala's investments. It includes GICS_SECTOR and UNREALIZED_VALUE, which directly matches the requirement to report exposure by GICS sector at the group level.
- Business Unit Sector View (BUSINESS_UNIT_BY_SECTOR_VW): This view aggregates by both business unit and sector, but the question does not ask for a business unit breakdown.
- Platform Sector View (PLATFORM_BY_SECTOR_VW): This view aggregates by both platform and sector, but the question does not ask for a platform breakdown.
- Investment KPI View and Active Deal List: These are deal-level views, not aggregated, and are not appropriate for a group-level sector exposure report.
- MIC KPI View: This is for overall group-level metrics but does not provide a sector breakdown.

6. **BUSINESS_UNIT_BY_COUNTRY_VW**: Aggregates at business unit and country, not platform or asset class.
7. **INVESTMENT_KPI_VW**: Contains deal-level data, with columns for platform, asset class, and country (with ISO codes for filtering). This view allows for precise filtering: platform = Real Assets, asset class = Infrastructure, country = USA (using COUNTRY_ISO_CODE2/3). It also contains UNREALIZED_VALUE_AED, which is the exposure.

**Conclusion:** 
- For ""exposures for the USA in Real Assets and Infrastructure,"" the only view that allows all three filters (platform, asset class, country) is the **INVESTMENT_KPI_VW**.

- Focusing on the UAE (country-level granularity).
- Looking at exposure (unrealized value) and its change over time (i.e., year-on-year comparison).

""Current exposures"" refers to the present fair market value or unrealized value of investments, and ""GCC"" (Gulf Cooperation Council) is a region, but the question is likely focused on the business unit or platform called ""GCC"" (which, in Mubadala's context, is often referred to as ""Group CEO & Managing Director Platform"" or similar, but here, based on the domain knowledge and platform list, it is not a standard platform name). However, the intent is to get exposures for a specific group or region and rank individual investments.

To answer this, we need:

- ""Active Deal List"" (ACTIVE_DEAL_LIST_VW) contains only target/expected investment size, not current exposures or valuations, so it is not suitable for current exposure.
- All other views are aggregated (platform, business unit, sector, region, etc.) and do not provide individual investment-level data, so they cannot be used to rank the top 10 investments.

Therefore, the only relevant view is ""Investment KPI View"" (INVESTMENT_KPI_VW), which should be used to extract the latest exposure (UNREALIZED_VALUE_AED) for each investment, filter for the relevant platform/business unit/region if ""GCC"" can be mapped, and then rank the top 10 by exposure.",0,INVESTMENT_KPI_VW,INVESTMENT_KPI_VW

First, let's clarify the requirements:
- ""Group level"" means the highest aggregation, i.e., across all of Mubadala, not by platform, business unit, sector, region, or country.
- The user specifies ""investment class"" and specifically ""Direct Investment"". However, in the candidate views, the investment class values at the group level (MIC_BY_INVESTMENT_CLASS_VW) are ""Fund Portfolio"", ""Private Portfolio"", and ""Public Portfolio"". There is no ""Direct Investment"" as an allowed value at the group level.
- The domain knowledge lists investment classes as: Private Equity, Real Estate, Infrastructure, Credit, Hedge Funds. ""Direct Investment"" is not a standard investment class in the provided allowed values, but may refer to direct holdings (as opposed to fund investments), which could map to ""Private Portfolio"" or ""Public Portfolio"" depending on context.

Now, let's check the views:
- MIC Investment Class View (MIC_BY_INVESTMENT_CLASS_VW) aggregates at investment class for all of Mubadala, which matches the ""Group level"" and ""investment class"" requirement. However, its allowed values for INVESTMENT_CLASS are ""Fund Portfolio"", ""Private Portfolio"", ""Public Portfolio"". There is no ""Direct Investment"" value.
- All other views either aggregate at a lower level (platform, business unit, sector, region, country) or do not aggregate by investment class at the group level.
- No view offers a ""Direct Investment"" filter at the group level, and none of the allowed values for investment class in MIC_BY_INVESTMENT_CLASS_VW match ""Direct Investment"" directly.

Conclusion:
- The best possible match is MIC_BY_INVESTMENT_CLASS_VW, but the user will need to map ""Direct Investment"" to one of the available investment class values (""Private Portfolio"" is the most likely, as it typically refers to direct holdings in companies, as opposed to ""Fund Portfolio"" which refers to investments via funds).

The allowed platform values are: Private Equity, Real Assets, ADIC, UAE Investments, Credit and Special Situations. 'FinTech' is not listed as a valid platform in any of the views or in the domain knowledge. 

Next, I review the candidate views:
- Platform KPI View, Platform Sector View, Platform Investment Class View, Platform Region View, Platform Country View: All these views aggregate by platform, but only for the allowed platforms (not 'FinTech').
- Investment KPI View and Active Deal List: These are for individual investments or deals, not for platform-level aggregation.
- MIC KPI View, MIC Sector View, MIC Asset Class View, MIC Region View, MIC Country View: These are for Mubadala-wide or sector/asset class/region/country aggregations, not for a specific platform.
- Business Unit KPI View, Business Unit Sector View, Business Unit Investment Class View, Business Unit Asset Class View, Business Unit Region View, Business Unit Country View: These are for business unit aggregations, not platforms.
- Allocations View, Consumption View: These are for capital allocation/consumption, not for returns.

Since 'FinTech' is not a recognized platform in the data model, and no view supports a 'FinTech' platform filter, there is no relevant view to answer this question.",0,PLATFORM_KPI_VW,<NO_VIEWS>

- Metric: RVPI
- Level: Business unit ('BU-Direct')
- Time: Latest (most recent data)

First, I need to identify which view(s) provide RVPI at the business unit aggregation level. Scanning the candidate views:
- ""Business Unit KPI View"" (BUSINESS_UNIT_KPI_VW) is specifically for ""aggregated metrics across multiple investments for an individual business unit level only"" and contains the RVPI field.
- ""Business Unit Sector View"", ""Business Unit Investment Class View"", ""Business Unit Asset Class View"", ""Business Unit Region View"", and ""Business Unit Country View"" all provide RVPI but only when a sector, investment class, asset class, region, or country breakdown is also requested. The question does not request any such breakdown.
- ""Investment KPI View"" is for individual investments, not for business unit aggregation.
- ""Platform KPI View"", ""MIC KPI View"", and others are for platform or company-wide aggregation, not business unit.
- ""Active Deal List"" and ""Consumption View"" do not provide RVPI or business unit aggregation.

Therefore, the ""Business Unit KPI View"" is the correct and only view that directly provides the latest RVPI for a business unit. I also need to check if 'BU-Direct' is a valid value for BUSINESS_UNIT in this view. The allowed values for BUSINESS_UNIT in ""Business Unit KPI View"" do not include 'BU-Direct' exactly, but there are similar names like ""Direct Budget Adjustment - Return (BU)"" and ""DI Budget Adjustment - Return (BU)"". If 'BU-Direct' is a user shorthand, the closest match is likely ""Direct Budget Adjustment - Return (BU)"". However, since the user asked for 'BU-Direct', and the view supports business unit-level queries, this is the best fit.",1,BUSINESS_UNIT_KPI_VW,BUSINESS_UNIT_KPI_VW

First, I need to identify which view(s) can provide DVPI at the intersection of platform and investment class. The key requirements are:
- Aggregation at both platform and investment class level (not individual deals, not just platform, not just investment class).
- Must include a DVPI metric.
- Must allow filtering by platform ('FinTech') and investment class ('Direct Investment').

Reviewing the candidate views:
- ""Platform Investment Class View"" (PLATFORM_BY_INVESTMENT_CLASS_VW) is specifically for metrics aggregated at BOTH investment class and platform level. It contains columns for PLATFORM, INVESTMENT_CLASS, and DVPI, and is designed for exactly this type of query.
- ""Platform KPI View"" is only at the platform level, not broken down by investment class.
- ""MIC Investment Class View"" is only at the investment class level, not by platform.
- ""Business Unit Investment Class View"" is at business unit + investment class, not platform.
- ""Active Deal List"" and ""Investment KPI View"" are for deal-level or individual investment-level data, not for aggregated platform/investment class metrics.
- The other views (sector, region, asset class, country, etc.) do not match the required aggregation.

However, I must check if 'FinTech' is a valid value for PLATFORM in the ""Platform Investment Class View"". The allowed values for PLATFORM in this view are: [""Credit and Special Situations"", ""MIC Corporate"", ""MIC Legacy Assets"", ""Private Equity"", ""Real Assets"", ""UAE Investments""]. 'FinTech' is not listed as a valid platform value. 

Additionally, for INVESTMENT_CLASS, the allowed values are: [""Fund Portfolio"", ""Private Portfolio"", ""Public Portfolio""]. 'Direct Investment' is not listed as a valid investment class value in this view.

Given these constraints, there is no view that allows filtering by both 'FinTech' as a platform and 'Direct Investment' as an investment class, because neither is an allowed value in the relevant view.

Therefore, none of the available views can answer the question as stated.",1,PLATFORM_BY_INVESTMENT_CLASS_VW,<NO_VIEWS>

First, let's clarify the requirements:
- ""BU-Direct"" refers to a business unit (likely ""ADIC-Direct Investments"" or similar, as per allowed values in the views).
- ""Infrastructure"" is an asset class.
- The metric is ""YTD_5_RETURN"".
- The user wants the latest data.

Now, let's match this to the available views:
- The question requires aggregation at BOTH business unit and asset class level.
- The only view that provides metrics at BOTH business unit and asset class level is ""Business Unit Asset Class View"" (BUSINESS_UNIT_BY_ASSET_CLASS_VW).
- This view has columns for BUSINESS_UNIT, ASSET_CLASS_NAME, and YTD_5_RETURN, and allows filtering by business unit and asset class.
- Other views either aggregate only by business unit, only by asset class, or do not allow the required breakdown.
- The ""Investment KPI View"" is for individual investments, not for aggregated business unit + asset class metrics.
- The business unit name in the question (""BU-Direct"") is not an exact match for the allowed values, but ""ADIC-Direct Investments"" is a close match and likely the intended value.

Therefore, the correct view to use is ""Business Unit Asset Class View"".",1,BUSINESS_UNIT_BY_ASSET_CLASS_VW,BUSINESS_UNIT_BY_ASSET_CLASS_VW

This requires a view that supports filtering by both region and asset class.

Let's analyze the candidate views:

1. **MIC Region View (MIC_BY_REGION_VW)**: Aggregates by region only, not by asset class. Cannot filter by both region and asset class simultaneously.
2. **MIC Asset Class View (MIC_BY_ASSET_CLASS_VW)**: Aggregates by asset class only, not by region. Cannot filter by both region and asset class simultaneously.
3. **Platform Region View, Platform Asset Class View, Business Unit Region View, Business Unit Asset Class View, etc.**: All aggregate by only one or two dimensions, but not both region and asset class together.
4. **Investment KPI View (INVESTMENT_KPI_VW)**: Contains deal-level/timestamped KPIs, including ITD_RETURN, REGION_OF_FUND, and ASSET_CLASS. This view allows filtering by both region ('Europe') and asset class ('Infrastructure') at the investment level, and can be aggregated as needed.
5. **Active Deal List**: Contains target/expected returns, not actual ITD_RETURN, and is for active deals, not historical performance.
6. **Consumption View**: Focuses on capital consumption, not returns.
7. **Other aggregated views (e.g., MIC_BY_COUNTRY_VW, PLATFORM_BY_REGION_VW, etc.)**: None allow simultaneous filtering by both region and asset class.

Therefore, the only view that allows filtering by both region and asset class and provides ITD_RETURN at the investment level is the **Investment KPI View (INVESTMENT_KPI_VW)**.

21,Provide the Group-level YTD_3_RETURN (latest).,,['MIC_KPI_VW'],MIC_KPI_VW,"The user is asking for the ""Group-level YTD_3_RETURN (latest)"". ""Group-level"" typically refers to the highest aggregation, i.e., the entire Mubadala group, not broken down by platform, business unit, sector, asset class, region, or country. The metric ""YTD_3_RETURN"" is the 3-year year-to-date internal rate of return, and ""latest"" means the most recent available data.

Reviewing the candidate views:
- ""MIC KPI View"" is specifically for TIMESTAMPED key performance indicators for investments aggregated across Mubadala WITHOUT mentioning specific platforms, business units, or geographical dimensions. It contains the ""YTD_3_RETURN"" column and is designed for group-level (i.e., Mubadala-wide) metrics.
- Other views (Platform KPI View, Business Unit KPI View, MIC_BY_SECTOR_VW, etc.) are for breakdowns by platform, business unit, sector, asset class, region, or country, which is not requested here.
- ""Investment KPI View"" is for individual investments, not group-level.
- ""Active Deal List"" is for deal-level, not group-level.
- ""Allocations View"" and ""Consumption View"" are about capital allocation/consumption, not returns.

""Group-level"" in this context refers to the overall Mubadala group, not a specific platform, business unit, sector, region, or investment class. The metric requested is ""ACTUAL_MOIC"", which is the Multiple on Invested Capital, and the user wants the latest value.

To select the correct view:
- The view must provide group-level (i.e., total Mubadala, not broken down by platform, business unit, sector, etc.) metrics.
- The view must include the ACTUAL_MOIC field.
- The view must provide the latest (timestamped) value.

Reviewing the candidate views:
- ""MIC KPI View"" (MIC_KPI_VW) is specifically described as containing ""TIMESTAMPED key performance indicators for investments aggregated across Mubadala WITHOUT mentioning specific platforms, business units, geographical dimensions"". It is for group-level metrics and includes ACTUAL_MOIC as a column.

- ""Investment KPI View"" is for individual investments, not group-level.
- ""Active Deal List"" is for deal-level, not group-level.

First, I need to determine if 'FinTech' is a valid platform in the context of Mubadala's data model. According to the domain knowledge and the allowed values in the candidate views, the valid platforms are: Private Equity, Real Assets, ADIC, UAE Investments, and Credit and Special Situations. 'FinTech' is not listed as a valid platform; it is more likely a sector, industry, or thematic area, not a platform.

The views that provide REFORECAST_RETURN at the platform level are:

- Platform Investment Class View (aggregated at both platform and investment class)
- Platform Sector View (aggregated at both platform and sector)
- Platform Region View (aggregated at both platform and region)
- Platform Country View (aggregated at both platform and country)

However, none of these views list 'FinTech' as an allowed value for PLATFORM. Instead, 'FinTech' might be represented as a sector, industry, or business unit, but not as a platform.

The term ""TARGET_RETURN"" is a key performance indicator (KPI) and is typically an aggregate metric at the business unit level, not at the individual deal level. The question does not mention a specific deal, platform, sector, asset class, or region, but is focused on the business unit as a whole.

Reviewing the candidate views:
- ""Business Unit KPI View"" (BUSINESS_UNIT_KPI_VW) is designed for aggregated KPIs at the business unit level and includes columns for various return metrics (ITD_RETURN, YTD_RETURN, etc.), but does not have a column named ""TARGET_RETURN"". It is the correct view for business unit-level KPIs.
- ""Investment KPI View"" (INVESTMENT_KPI_VW) contains ""TARGET_RETURN"" but is for individual investments/deals, not for business unit aggregates.
- ""Active Deal List"" is for current/active deals and their target metrics, not for business unit aggregates.
- Other views (Platform KPI, MIC KPI, sector, region, asset class, etc.) are not relevant because the question is not about platforms, sectors, regions, or asset classes.

However, the business unit name 'BU-Direct' does not appear in the allowed values for BUSINESS_UNIT in any of the business unit-level views. The closest matches are ""ADIC-Direct Investments"" and ""Direct Budget Adjustment - Return (BU)"", but not ""BU-Direct"". If ""BU-Direct"" is a user shorthand for ""ADIC-Direct Investments"" or another business unit, clarification would be needed. If not, and if ""BU-Direct"" is not present in the allowed values, then no view can directly answer the question.

Given the above, the correct view for business unit-level target returns would be ""Business Unit KPI View"" if the business unit existed in the allowed values. Since ""BU-Direct"" is not present, there is no relevant view.",1,BUSINESS_UNIT_KPI_VW,BUSINESS_UNIT_KPI_VW

- Investment-level (not aggregate) data, as the user wants a list of individual investments, not an aggregate or summary by country, platform, or class.
- The ability to filter by country (USA), which is ""United States of America"" or its ISO codes.
- The ability to sort and select by YTD_RETURN (year-to-date return), and to get the latest data for each investment.

Reviewing the candidate views:
- ""Investment KPI View"" (INVESTMENT_KPI_VW) contains timestamped KPIs for each investment, including YTD_RETURN, country (with ISO codes for filtering), and allows for selection of the latest data per investment. It is specifically designed for questions about the performance of individual investments, and its selector says to use it for historical deal/investment-level queries, especially when filtering by geography and return metrics.
- ""Active Deal List"" (ACTIVE_DEAL_LIST_VW) contains target/expected returns and deal pipeline data, but not actual YTD_RETURN or realized performance. It is not suitable for listing top investments by actual YTD_RETURN.
- All other views are for aggregated data (by country, platform, sector, etc.) and do not provide investment-level granularity.

- ""in Asia"": We need to filter by the Asia business unit or region.
- ""lowest ITD_RETURN"": We need a view that provides ITD_RETURN (inception-to-date return) at the sector level, and allows us to filter for Asia.
- ""last year"": We need a view with timestamped/yearly data, so we can select the most recent year.

Reviewing the candidate views:
- MIC Sector View: Aggregates by sector, but does not allow filtering by region or business unit (Asia).
- Business Unit Sector View: Aggregates by BOTH sector and business unit. The BUSINESS_UNIT column includes ""Asia"" as an allowed value, and GICS_SECTOR is present. ITD_RETURN is available.

- Platform Sector View: Aggregates by sector and platform, but not by business unit or region.
- Business Unit KPI View: Aggregates by business unit, but not by sector.
- Other views (Active Deal List, Allocations, Consumption, etc.): Not relevant, as they do not provide sector-level aggregation or the required filters.

- The metric of interest is YTD_RETURN.

However, ""Direct Investment"" is not a standard investment class in the provided views; instead, it is likely a deployment model or business unit (e.g., ""ADIC-Direct Investments"" as a business unit). The question is ambiguous, but the intent is to get performance metrics (TARGET_RETURN and ACTUAL_MOIC) for direct investments at a group/aggregate level.

Let's break down the requirements:
- The user wants aggregate metrics (not deal-level), so views with individual deal data (like ""Active Deal List"" or ""Investment KPI View"") are not appropriate unless no aggregate view can provide the required filter.
- The user is not asking for a specific platform, sector, asset class, or region, but for ""Group 'Direct Investment' investment class."" This suggests a need for a view that aggregates by investment class, possibly at the business unit or group level.
- The only views that aggregate by investment class are:
  - MIC Investment Class View (MIC_BY_INVESTMENT_CLASS_VW): Aggregates at investment class for all Mubadala, but its allowed values for INVESTMENT_CLASS are ""Fund Portfolio"", ""Private Portfolio"", ""Public Portfolio""—not ""Direct Investment"".
  - Platform Investment Class View (PLATFORM_BY_INVESTMENT_CLASS_VW): Aggregates by both platform and investment class, but again, investment class values are ""Fund Portfolio"", ""Private Portfolio"", ""Public Portfolio"".
  - Business Unit Investment Class View (BUSINESS_UNIT_BY_INVESTMENT_CLASS_VW): Aggregates by business unit and investment class, with allowed values including ""ADIC-Direct Investments"" for BUSINESS_UNIT and ""Fund Portfolio"", ""Private Portfolio"", ""Public Portfolio"" for INVESTMENT_CLASS.
