      "combined_reasoning": "=== STAGE 1: ENTITY RESOLUTION ===\n1. **Identify terms in query that match entity candidates:**\n   - The query mentions \"Direct Investment\" and \"investment class\".\n   - \"Direct Investment\" closely resembles \"ADIC-Direct Investments\" from the BUSINESS_UNIT list.\n   - \"investment class\" suggests a match with the INVESTMENT_CLASS entity type.\n\n2. **Apply disambiguation rules based on context keywords:**\n   - The term \"investment class\" directly corresponds to the INVESTMENT_CLASS entity type.\n\n3. **Match terms to EXACT values from entity_mapper.json:**\n   - \"Direct Investment\" matches exactly with \"ADIC-Direct Investments\" in the BUSINESS_UNIT list.\n   - \"investment class\" does not have a direct match in the INVESTMENT_CLASS list, but the context suggests it refers to the type of investment, which is not explicitly listed.\n\n4. **Validate: no partial matches, no JSON artifacts, proper capitalization:**\n   - \"ADIC-Direct Investments\" is an exact match with proper capitalization.\n   - No partial matches or JSON artifacts are present.\n\nResolved Entities: {\"BUSINESS_UNIT\": \"ADIC-Direct Investments\"}\n\n=== STAGE 2: VIEW SELECTION ===\n1. **Analyze question keywords and resolved entities**: The question asks for \"TARGET_RETURN\" and \"ACTUAL_MOIC (latest)\" for the \"Direct Investment\" investment class within the \"ADIC-Direct Investments\" business unit. The resolved entity is \"BUSINESS_UNIT: ADIC-Direct Investments\".\n\n2. **Match entities to appropriate view dimensions**: The question involves specific metrics (TARGET_RETURN and ACTUAL_MOIC) for a particular investment class and business unit. This suggests a need for a view that can provide data at the investment class and business unit level.\n\n3. **Consider special cases**: The question does not specify active deals or historical investments, but it does require the latest data for a specific investment class and business unit.\n\n4. **Evaluate each candidate view's relevance**:\n   - **ACTIVE_DEAL_LIST_VW**: This view is for active deals and target metrics, but it does not provide actual performance metrics like ACTUAL_MOIC.\n   - **INVESTMENT_KPI_VW**: This view provides detailed performance metrics, including MOIC, at an individual investment level. It is suitable for historical or specific investment queries.\n   - **BUSINESS_UNIT_BY_INVESTMENT_CLASS_VW**: This view aggregates metrics at both the investment class and business unit level, which matches the query's requirement for aggregated data by investment class and business unit.\n\n5. **Final decision with justification**: The BUSINESS_UNIT_BY_INVESTMENT_CLASS_VW is the most appropriate view because it aggregates data at both the investment class and business unit level, which aligns with the query's requirement for metrics specific to the \"Direct Investment\" class within the \"ADIC-Direct Investments\" business unit. The INVESTMENT_KPI_VW could be used for detailed investment-level data, but the query seems to require aggregated data.\n\nSelected Views: BUSINESS_UNIT_BY_INVESTMENT_CLASS_VW",
