    "| 1. View Selection | DSPy | **High** - Entity resolution + multi-dimensional matching | ~3s | ✅ GEPA/Bootstrap |\n",

    "   - **Lightweight Agent**: Where speed matters more (Answer formatting)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimizable Components** 🔄\n",
    "   - IntegratedText2SQL: Optimize with GEPA (15-20% accuracy gain)\n",

    "| Aspect | Single Agent + Tools | Multi-Agent Architecture |\n",
    "|--------|---------------------|-------------------------|\n",
    "| **Structure** | One agent with 5 tools | 4 specialized agents + orchestrator |\n",
    "| **Complexity** | Simpler setup | More complex coordination |\n",
    "| **Reasoning** | Single context window | Distributed reasoning across agents |\n",
    "| **Debugging** | Harder to isolate issues | Easier - test agents independently |\n",
    "| **Scalability** | Limited by context size | Each agent has fresh context |\n",
    "| **Parallelization** | Sequential tool calls | Potential for parallel agent execution |\n",
    "| **Error Handling** | One failure affects all | Isolated failures, easier recovery |\n",
    "| **Cost** | Lower (1 agent session) | Higher (multiple agent sessions) |\n",
    "| **Best For** | Simple workflows, cost-sensitive | Complex workflows, modularity needed |\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Each:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single Agent + Tools** (like `complete_text2sql_workflow`):\n",
    "- ✅ Simpler workflows with clear sequential steps\n",
    "- ✅ Cost-sensitive applications\n",
    "- ✅ When all tasks fit in one context window\n",
    "- ✅ Fast prototyping and testing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Agent Architecture** (like `multi_agent_text2sql_workflow`):\n",
    "- ✅ Complex workflows with many specialized tasks\n",
    "- ✅ When different tasks require different expertise\n",
    "- ✅ Need for parallel execution\n",
    "- ✅ Better error isolation and testing\n",
    "- ✅ Larger applications with team specialization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Multi-Agent Patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hierarchical**: Supervisor agent delegates to worker agents\n",
    "2. **Sequential**: Agents pass work in a pipeline\n",
    "3. **Parallel**: Multiple agents work simultaneously, results merged\n",
    "4. **Collaborative**: Agents discuss and reach consensus\n",
    "5. **Competitive**: Multiple agents propose solutions, best one selected\n",
    "\n",
    "For your Text-to-SQL use case, **single agent + tools is recommended** for production due to:\n",
    "- Lower cost (one agent session)\n",
    "- Sufficient for sequential workflow\n",
    "- Easier to maintain and deploy\n",
    "- Faster execution (no agent handoff overhead)\n",

    "\n",
    "| Architecture | LLM Calls per Task | Total LLM Calls | Agent Overhead |\n",
    "|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Single Agent + Tools** | 2 (agent + DSPy) | ~10 calls | Low - reuses context |\n",
    "| **Multi-Agent** | 2 per agent × 4 agents | ~16+ calls | High - fresh context each time |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Approach 1 (Single Agent) is Better:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Fewer LLM Calls**: One agent context across all steps  \n",
    "✅ **Lower Cost**: ~40% fewer LLM invocations  \n",
    "✅ **Faster**: No agent-to-agent handoff overhead  \n",
    "✅ **Shared Context**: Agent maintains conversation history  \n",
    "✅ **Simpler Debugging**: Single agent conversation to trace  \n",
    "\n",
    "### When Multi-Agent Might Make Sense:\n",
    "\n",
    "Only use multi-agent if you need:\n",
    "- **Different LLM models** per task (e.g., GPT-4o for view selection, GPT-4o-mini for schema lookup)\n",
    "- **True parallelization** of independent tasks\n",
    "- **Agent specialization** with different prompt templates and temperature settings\n",
    "- **Fault isolation** where agent failures shouldn't affect others\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation for Your Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Single Agent + Tools (Approach 1)** because:\n",
    "1. Your workflow is strictly sequential (can't parallelize)\n",
    "2. All tasks use the same LLM model (GPT-4o)\n",
    "3. Tasks need shared context (entities, views, schemas)\n",
    "4. Cost and speed matter more than modularity\n",

    "The multi-agent pattern is educational but not optimal for this specific Text-to-SQL pipeline."
